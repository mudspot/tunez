Known for their heavy guitar riffs, electronic synth textures, and commanding vocals, Resonanz combines the aggressive force of metal with the industrial sounds that echo the gritty reality of post-reunification Germany.\n\nTheir lyrics, delivered in a mix of German and occasionally English, explore themes of societal issues, personal strife, and the human condition, often presented through powerful, metaphorical imagery. Resonanz's stage presence is intense and theatrical, featuring elaborate lighting, pyrotechnics, and a stark, industrial aesthetic that complements their sonic assault."
